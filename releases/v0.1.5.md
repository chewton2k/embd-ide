# V(0.1.5)

### New Features

#### Git Integration
- **Git Fetch Button**  
  Added a dedicated **Git Fetch** button to pull remote changes without merging.
- **Fetch File Indicators in Explorer**  
  After fetching, files that were changed or added remotely are now marked in the file explorer with a **↓ down arrow** and **M** indicator — consistent with VS Code's remote change display.
- **Git Merge Conflict UI**  
  Introduced a dedicated merge conflict interface for resolving conflicts directly inside the IDE without needing an external tool.
- **Branch History Scoped to Current Branch**  
  The history tab in the Git panel now only shows commits for the branch you're currently on, eliminating noise from unrelated branch history.
- **Branch Delete Button**  
  Added a **trash icon** next to each branch in the branch list for quick deletion without navigating away.

### Editor & Productivity Enhancements

#### Buffer Navigation
- **Cmd + Shift + [ / ]**  
  New keyboard shortcuts to cycle left and right between open buffers — faster tab switching without reaching for the mouse.

#### Search & Replace
- **Replace / Replace All Result Count**  
  After running a replace or replace all, the IDE now reports how many instances were replaced.
- **Find Instance Count**  
  The find bar now displays the total number of matches found in the current file.

### Project & File Management

#### Project Switching
- **Tab Cleanup on Project Open**  
  When opening a new project, all non-pinned tabs are now automatically closed — keeping pinned tabs intact and preventing cross-project tab bleed.
- **Recent Projects**  
  Added a **Recent Projects** panel so you can quickly reopen previously accessed projects and return to where you left off.

### Bug Fixes

- **File Changes Now Reflect Immediately**  
  Fixed an issue where AI-driven file edits (Claude) required manually switching tabs before changes were visible. Files now reload in place automatically.
- **Git Push Upstream Fix**  
  Resolved the `set-upstream origin` error that occurred when pushing after switching branches.
- **Staging Deleted Files**  
  Fixed a bug where attempting to stage deletions of removed files failed silently or produced errors.
- **Responsive Layout Fix**  
  Fixed layout breakage where resizing the window to a smaller size would cause UI elements to reflow or overlap incorrectly.
