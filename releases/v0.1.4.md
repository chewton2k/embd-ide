### Editor & Productivity Enhancements

#### Multi-Cursor Editing
- **Alt + Click Multi-Cursor Support**  
  Holding **Alt** and left-clicking now spawns multiple cursors, enabling faster bulk edits and advanced editing workflows.

#### Tab Management Improvements
- **Increased Tab Limit**  
  Users can now keep more files open simultaneously.
- **Pinned Tabs**  
  Tabs can be pinned to prevent them from being overwritten or reordered—ideal for frequently referenced files.

#### Error & Diagnostics

### File System & Navigation

#### Drag & Drop Enhancements
- **Drag & Drop from OS → IDE**  
  Files can now be dragged directly from the operating system into the IDE.
- **Custom File Placement**  
  File ordering is no longer strictly alphabetical. When dragging files or folders, placement is based on cursor drop location, giving users full control over organization.

#### Context Menu Improvements
- **Adaptive Right-Click Menu Positioning**  
  Fixed an issue where context menus could be clipped near the bottom of the screen. Menus now reposition automatically to remain fully visible.

#### Sticky File Tree
- Removed the logo header from the top-left.
- The **parent directory in the file tree is now sticky**, ensuring project context remains visible while navigating.

### File Handling & Reliability

#### Save & Refresh Behavior

  Added a visual indicator to show when files are saved or modified.
- **Automatic File Refresh**  
  Open files now auto-refresh when changed externally (e.g., Git operations or external tools).

  Improved reliability and correctness of undo and redo operations across editing sessions.
